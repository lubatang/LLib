 Execution Instructions
========================
  The simplest way to run this program is:

  1. ./run.sh [Path of Test Directory]

  For example: ./run.sh Color\ Models/"

  When the program is running, there are keys to control the model:

  - L/l: control the position of light.
    When the light is under control, you can use SPACE key to switch the mouse
    mode. There are three mouse modes:
    1. Move   - move the position of light along to X- and Y-axis.
    2. Rotate - rotate the position of light by the center of model.
    3. Spot   - rotate the direction of light. This will affect spot light.

  - T/t: control the position of model.
    When the model is under control, you can use SPACE key to switch the mouse
    mode. Like L/l, T/t has three mouse modes:
    1. Move   - move the position of the model by X- and Y-axis.
    2. Rotate - rotate the model by the center of model.
    3. Scale  - scaling the model.

  - V/v: control the position of eye.
    Original behavior.

Compilation Instructions
========================
  The simplest way to compile this package is:

  1.  Download LLib tarball

  2.  Type `cd ${LLib}' to the directory containing the source code.

  3.  If there are no `configure' shell script in the directory, type
      `./autogen.sh' to generate `configure' script.

  4.  Type `./configure` to configure the package for your system. See INSTALL
      for more details.

  5.  Type `make` to compile the package

  6.  Type `make install` to install the package into your system.

  7.  Type `./run.sh [Path of Test Directory]` to run the program.
